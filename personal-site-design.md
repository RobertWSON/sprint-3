What is your site's primary purpose?


To promote myself outside of Dev Academy in the future and to share my website creation during my time at EDA. 



Who is your target audience?


My main target audience is initially everyone at EDA. My main goal in the long term is to have a portfolio, so that Companies can have the opportunity to have a look at an example of web development I have done with the intention of maybe hiring me.    


How do you want visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?


I would want any visitors to be able to navigate easily throughout my website and be able to see parts of it in sections for example all technical blogs in one section. The layout has to be able to adjust between mobile phones and desktop devices. I also want users to be able to view each web page in an f pattern, as much as possible.   



How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?


I will have to readjust my current website so that it can use responsive design for mobile and desktop. I will be using normalize and skeleton css template, as well as my own custom css rules in order to do this.
